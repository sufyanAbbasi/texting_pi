I've ignored files in this "secret" folder on git, for obvious reasons. There should be a couple files in here.

This first is auth.py which has has two variables for Twilio defined:

auth.py: 
	account_sid = <SID>
	auth_token

and the other two files are pickle files which should automatically be generated by running the program (I hope).
